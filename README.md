# Jacob's Weather App

## Description

This is an app designed to tell you the weather in an area you enter.  The focus behind this project is to help learn how to integrate third party APIs into a website.  This uses a variety of different third party tools to help create the site.  This lesson taught me how to successfuly browse and use Bootstrap to help create the CSS.  I also had to learn how to apply for an API key which I needed to use the OpenWeather API.
